## Sports Skuyy

This project is our job as students who are assigned to create java-based android applications and are useful for daily life, therefore our team makes Sports Skuyy applications that aim to help our lives to be even more enthusiastic in sports.

### Screenshot

### Requirements API 

Devices must use a minimum API 23 (Android Marshmallow) and a maximum using an API 28 (Android Pie).

### Bug

```markdown
You can change the background image for an application into a shape 
because on an Android device that has a screen of less than 5.5 inch 
the application will suffer damage in the background and the worst is 
the application will experience a force close.
```

### Documentation

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rdp77/SportsSkuyy/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
